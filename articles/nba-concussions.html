    <h1>ðŸ§  Concussions in the NBA: An Untold Story</h1>
    <p><em>Published July 2025</em></p>
    <p>
      While football gets most of the attention when it comes to concussions, basketball is no stranger to head injuries. Using publicly available data and player histories, we dive into the underreported world of NBA concussions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players like Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons have had documented concussion histories, and the leagueâ€™s protocol continues to evolve. We analyzed trends across seasons, team differences, return timelines, and gaps in reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key findings:</strong><br />
      - Most concussions occur mid-season (Januaryâ€“March)<br />
      - Guards have a higher rate than forwards/centers<br />
      - Recovery timelines vary wildly â€” from 2 to 14 days<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Weâ€™ll continue this series with deeper case studies, and links to neurology literature in the next installment.
